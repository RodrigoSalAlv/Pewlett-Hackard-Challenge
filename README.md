 - Most of them are in the departments that has the most retirement employees

## Summary
Based in the information obtained in this analysis we have the next call outs:

 1. The people inside the "silver-tsunami" are a total of 72,458 employees, however that doesn't mean that we need to filled up the total quantity of employees that are retiring, this also is an opportunity to re-evaluate the activities that some of them were carrying out. Perhaps many activities of them are no longer necessary or with the current technology could be replaced by automated processes. As I mention before

 2. For the people that are able to mentoring, we can see that also most of them are in the engineering and staff department. This means that we can dedicate most of the mentors to the departments that will have the largest number of retired employees. However they represent 1% of the main departments with higher retirement employees, perhaps we will have a lack of mentors for the Engineering and Staff departments
